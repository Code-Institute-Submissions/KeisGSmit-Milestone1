# Covid Comfort

Since late December 2019, until now, the world has been changed by a pandemic.
 The Covid-19 (Respiratory disease) virus has spread to all the areas of the world.
  The scale of this pandemic can be compared to the swine flu pandemic in 2010 or the Spanish flu in 1918.
 The pandemic had a massive shock on the stock market.
  This left many essential workers with the short end of the stick.
   The aim of the website is to help the essential workers make ends meet.
    “Covid Comfort” Aims to compensate for the social divide.
     Essential workers normally survive on pay cheque to pay cheque and there are no extra funds for extra expenses.
      “Covid Comfort” wants to bridge that social issue; it aims to supply people on the front line with some funds so that
       they can afford personal protective equipment, 
       help them afford their rent or just help them afford their next meal. 

We- The human race- need to come together and unite now more than ever, 
helping each other, to flatten the curve of the virus so that we can return to our normal 
lives again, as fast as possible. 

 
## UX
 
In this section I want to provide a deep insight into my UX process.
 I have explored [the strategy plane, the scope plane and the structure plane](readme_files/theuxdesign.pdf) in as much depth as I possibly could.
The link should open a pdf file. 

I mentioned in the pdf that I will provide a list of User Stories. 
We will assume all Users will start at the landing page. The User can then navigate through the site as they wish to achieve other goals of other users. 

- As a Donator I want to got to the donate section, so that I can donate money to "Covid Comfort", to help an essential worker. 

This is done by clicking the "Donate" button in the main navigation bar. This will take the user to the donate section. The User would then complete the form and click on "Donate". 
If all fields are completed, a modal will appear with feedback to the user that they have successfully donated their amount of money to "Covid Comfort". 

- As an essential worker, I want to apply to "Covid Comfort", to be able to get the benefits they offer.

This feature is not available yet, including a contact section. This will be implemented in future updates.

- As any User, I want to learn more about "Covid Comfort", to see what the company offers and who they are helping. 

This is done by clicking the "Learn More" buttton in the navigation bar. This will take the users to the "Learn more" section where they can read through the content of the page 
and proccess the information presented. 

- As any user, I want to navigate to other sites that provide more information and accept donations properly.

The user will need to reach the footer in any way they wish. Sites that provide more information are linked under the "Please educate yourself" section. 
Sites that provide the user with the ability to donate to an organisation are linked in under the "If you do wish to donate" section 

- As any user, I want to check the legality of this website, so that I can verify its legitimacy.

The user will need to reach the footer in any way they wish. Under the "Legal" section, it provides more information to the user. 
The user can then decide what to do next. 

I have prepared [wireframes/mockups](readme_files/TheFinal.pdf) created in Balsamiq mockups 3. The desktop and mobile first approaches have been included as part of the design process. 


## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features

- The main navigation bar - It allows all users to navigate through different sections of the site, by them clicking on any links.
- The secondary navigation bar (found at the bottom of each main section) - allows all users to navigate through to other sections of the site, to accomplish ease of navigation for a positive user experience. 
- The external links in the footer - It allows users to go to legitimate sites and read the legality of this site. This was done to try and maintain the image of a proffessional student project.
- The Form - It allows any user wishing to donate to help an essential worker, have them fill out a form that provides users with feedback. It has form validation implemented as well.

### Features Left to Implement
- A contact page will be needed in the future. This will be done once the main offices have been established (I do not want to display somebody else's address or possible contact information unknowingly).
- A registration form will need to be implemented but will require a lot more legal inestigation due to the site being scaled to an international audience.
- In the future a possible e-commerce backend could be implemented but only once the required skills have been gained. 

## Technologies Used

In this section, I will mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that I have used to construct this project.
 For each, I provided its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used. 
 Some of these are sites where code was taken from or media was taken from. 
 Due to my understanding of the term "libraries" I have included all the sites I have used to create this website.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
    - This was the programming language I used to construct the skeleton of the website and provide content.
- [CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3)
    - This is the Programming language I Used to style my content. 
- [Java Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
    - I used this programming language to implement my form validation and change content on the site alongside Bootstrap.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - Bootstrap provided me with external CSS code and scripts to help me style my website and make it mobile responsive.
- [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery)
    - Icons for the content in the footer was taken from Font Awesome. 
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
    - Google Fonts provided the fonts for the website
- [Palletton](https://paletton.com/#uid=1000u0kllllaFw0g0qFqFg0w0aF)
    - This website was used to help choose the colour pallet for the website to make it look proffessional. 
- [Logomakr](https://logomakr.com/)
    - Logomakr was used to create the logo of the company in the top navigation bar. 
- [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)
    - Autoprefixer was used to make my CSS code run on as my browsers as possible.

    - This website provided me with media I used for my landing page 
- [Markup Validation service](https://validator.w3.org/) 
    - I used the W3C Validation service to Validate my HTML and CSS code before I did my final commit.

    - Gitpod was the online IDE extension that I used to write my code.
- [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) 
    - Visual Studio Code was used with Gitpod at a stage in this project but due to the lack of experience it was not used much, due to technical issues. 
    - VSC was first implemented to compensate for a bad internet connection, by acting as an offline IDE. 
- [Microsoft Office](https://www.office.com/)
    - Microsoft Word was used to spell check content of the repository and create pdf files. 
    - Microsoft Excel was used to create the table in [the strategy plane, the scope plane and the structure plane](readme_files/theuxdesign.pdf) pdf.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well.
 Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, 
 with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach,
 link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant.
 A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
