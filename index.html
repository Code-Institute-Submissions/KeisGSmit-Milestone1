					<h3>Why do essential workers need help?</h3>
					<p>
						If you have not read,<a href="#info"> Learn more</a>, I would encourage you to
						do so. As you can see these people are in dire need of help for their day to day activities.
						These people are on the edge of survival. That is why we need your help.
					</p>

					<h3>How will these donations benefit an essential worker?</h3>
					<p>
						The aim of these donations is to supply these essential workers with some funds to be able to
						afford their next meal, contribute to their rent, enable them to buy personal protective
						equipment and to take care of themselves due to their position in this pandemic.
					</p>
					<h3>When will essential workers be receiving the donations?</h3>
					<p>
						As soon as you have made a donation, the funds will be sent to our applicants, who have applied
						directly, and will be distributed in a just manner to all applicants.
					</p>

				<h2>Who are the essential workers, which we are helping?</h2>
				
					<p>The Food Industry -Businesses that primarily sell food, beverages and consumer products
							necessary
							to maintain households and businesses like grocery stores, retailers and restaurants</p>
					<p>Services - Primarily that focus on customer service like pharmacies, healthcare, retail
							workers, community services, child care services, Health care and social services </p>
					<p>Agricultural and food production - Businesses that produce food and beverages, and
							agricultural products including plants, including farming, harvesting, aquaculture, hunting
							and
							fishing.</p>
					<p>We will not be providing help to supply chains, financial services, telecommunications
							providers, Transportation services, manufacturing, Construction, sports, research, Resource
							and
							energy - We see the people working under these sectors as a responsibility of their
							employers.
						</p>
           
				

				<h2>What are the struggles of these essential worker?</h2>
				
					<p>The <a href="http://www.ufcw.org/">UFCW</a> had major chains, which prohibited workers from
							wearing face
							masks and gloves while working, lift those restrictions, with some workers gaining hazard
							pay
							but the amount is insignificant. Most employees request personal protective equipment (hand
							sanitizer and disinfectant wipes). Not all the demands of the employees are being met.</p>
					<p>Ride-hail drivers are having a massive decline in customers and Shift workers have lost
							their
							jobs and/or had their shifts cut. These people have requested unemployment benefits, but
							that is
							being declined due to the lack of legal clarity (ride-hail drivers) or their benefits do not
							cover their living costs (Service workers)</p>
					<p>The <a href="http://www.ufcw.org/">UFCW</a> has also supported Healthcare services but there
							is
							a lack of paid time off and no paid
							sick days, this lead to more protests.</p>
					<p>Agricultural industries are at risk due to them running on skeleton staff, again placing a
							massive strain on the food supply. Unlike the retail workers the <a
								href="https://ufw.org/">United farm workers union</a> has tried to provide workers with
							sick
							pay to 40 hours or more to maintain
							the food supply belt. </p>
					<p>In-home supportive service workers have a low hourly pay and only 9% get employee-sponsored
							healthcare. Many of them work with people who are immune-compromised. Domestic workers, are
							asked by their employers to not return to work, as there is fear of spreading the virus, but
							since many who are employed are not legally employed, they cannot apply for unemployment
							insurance. Neither of these services is provided with personal protection equipment.</p>
